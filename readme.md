## Airflow Project

Here in this project, we will crete an airflow structure and pipeline throught docker-copmpose to connect with a postgresql docker image, and create tables with fictitious data in order to populate an aplication that will consume this information.

As we do this, the idea is to understand how to use docker and how we can create the pipeline and communication between multiple docker images.
